# Raman-Scans
This folder contains the following data types:
1. Raw Raman Scan files for use with RametrixTM
2. Total Spectral Distance (TSD) calculations
3. Total Principal Component Distance (TPD) calculations
4. Total Canonical Distance (TCD) calculations
5. Results of statistical analyses

Note: One or more data types (not necessarily all) are available for each publication.
